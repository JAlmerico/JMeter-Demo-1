# Beta Breakers JMeter Demo

This script demonstrates the ability to automate Jmeter tests using maven commands.  This functionality can be further automated by integration with CI tools such as Jenkins and Bamboo.

Quick Start
------
1. Clone or Download Repository
2. Open Terminal (OSX) or cmd (Win) to the downloaded directory
3. In the terminal, enter the command "mvn verify install"
4. Allow the script to run to completion
5. Once completed, logs will be generated in the following locations
  * Organized logs can be found in jmeter-demo/target/site
  * Raw data can be found in jmeter-demo/target/jmeter/logs
  

Additional Arguments
------
* Thread count (Users in Jmeter are referred to as threads), loop count (number of complete test iterations), and ramp-up time (Total allotted time for all threads to start) can be defined by command line arguments by using the -D tag.  For example, the command [mvn verify install -Dthreads=5 -Dramp=10] would run the test with 5 threads with a ramp-up time of 10 seconds and it would use the default value for the iteration count.

* Users can also specify other .jmx files to run by entering the -D argument in the command line with the variable test-name, and assuring that the new test is placed in the jmeter-demo/target/jmeter/testFiles directory.  For example, the command [mvn verify install -Dtest-name=test.jmx] would call maven to execute the test.jmx script.
  
Additional Information
------
* The index.html file that is generated by the script is for organizing large amounts of logs, and isn't used in this implementation

* If the /target/ directory is not present, it will be generated when the script is executed
